# Custom Bidding Script Builder

**Create Custom Bidding scripts without writing any Python**


## Context

Expressing a DV360 Custom KPI that correlates with real business outcomes is technically complex and typically requires knowledge of Python to construct scripts.

This barrier to entry prevents its target user base from being able to utilize DV360 Custom Bidding to express complex KPIs and leverage the additional functionality only unlocked by scripts.

This solution will allow users to input values into a Sheets-based UI and the solution will deliver a fully executable Custom Bidding script.
